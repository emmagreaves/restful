        <h3>Relaxation response</h3>
        <p class="text-justify">
            The term "Relaxation Response" was coined by Dr. Herbert Benson, professor, author,
            cardiologist, and founder of Harvard’s Mind/Body Medical Institute.
            The response is defined as your personal ability to encourage your body to release chemicals and brain signals
            that make your muscles and organs slow down and increase blood flow to the brain.
            <br>
            <br>
            The Relaxation Response is essentially the opposite reaction to the “fight or flight” response.
            According to Dr. Benson, using the Relaxation Response is beneficial, as it counteracts the
            physiological effects of stress and the fight or flight response. The Relaxation Response is a helpful way
            to turn off the fight-or-flight response and bring the body back to pre-stress levels.
            <br>
            <br>
            Research has shown that regular use of the Relaxation Response can help any health problem that is caused
            or exacerbated by chronic stress such as fibromyalgia, gastrointestinal ailments, insomnia, hypertension,
            anxiety disorders, and others.
            <br>
            <br>
            The best time to practice the Relaxation Response is first thing in the morning for 10 to 20 minutes -
            this is in line with our minimum rest times. Practicing just once or twice daily can be enough to counteract the
            stress response and bring about deep relaxation and inner peace.

        <h5>In order to trigger the Relaxation Response, follow the steps below:</h3>
        <p class="text-justify">
            <br>
            1. Sit quietly in a comfortable position.
            <br>
            <br>
            2. Close your eyes.
            <br>
            <br>
            3. Deeply relax all your muscles.
            <br>
            <br>
            4. Breathe through your nose. Become aware of your breathing. As you breathe out, say the word “ONE” silently to yourself. For example, breathe IN---OUT, “ONE”: IN…OUT, “ONE”: etc. Breathe easily and naturally.
            <br>
            <br>
            5. Continue for 10 to 20 minutes. You may open your eyes to check the time, but do not use an alarm. When you finish, sit quietly for several minutes, at first with your eyes closed and later with your eyes opened. Do not stand up for a few minutes.
            <br>
            <br>
            6. Do not worry about whether you are successful in achieving a deep level of relaxation. Maintain a passive attitude and permit relaxation to occur at its own pace. When distracting thoughts occur, merely return to repeating “ONE.”
