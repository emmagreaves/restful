                    <p class="text-justify" style="font-size:11px;">
                        The term “Relaxation Response” was coined by Dr. Herbert Benson. The response is defined as your personal ability to encourage your body to release chemicals and brain signals that make your muscles and organs slow down, increasing blood flow to the brain. Regular practice of the Relaxation Response can be an effective treatment for a wide range of stress-related disorders.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Using the Relaxation Response is beneficial, as it counteracts the physiological effects of stress and the fight or flight response. It is a physical state of deep relaxation which engages the parasympathetic nervous system and brings the body back to its pre-stress levels.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>The best time to practice the Relaxation Response is first thing in the morning for 10 to 20 minutes - this is in line with our minimum rest times. Practicing just once or twice daily can be enough to counteract the stress response and bring about deep relaxation and inner peace.</strong>
